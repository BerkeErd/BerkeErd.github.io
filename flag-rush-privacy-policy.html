    <h1>Privacy Policy for Flag Rush: Marble Racing</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 28, 2025</p>
    <p>Beruke Games (“we”, “our”, “us”) built the <strong>Flag Rush: Marble Racing</strong> app as a free app. This Service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected, how it is used, and your choices when you use the app.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not directly collect, store, or share personal information on our own servers.</strong> Gameplay is processed locally on your device.</p>
    <p>However, the app integrates third‑party services that may automatically collect limited information for advertising, analytics, or platform functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Advertising (Google AdMob):</strong> Used to show rewarded ads required to save a custom flag. AdMob may collect device information (e.g., device identifiers, IP address, coarse location, ad interactions) to deliver, measure, and (where applicable) personalize ads.</li>
      <li><strong>Unity Engine:</strong> The app is built with Unity’s technology, which may collect non‑personal, technical data for platform functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Custom Flags (User‑Provided Images)</h2>
    <p>You can import an image from your device to create a <strong>Custom Flag</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Imported images, thumbnails, and related settings are <strong>saved locally on your device only</strong> and are <strong>not uploaded</strong> to our servers.</li>
      <li>You can delete Custom Flags at any time from <em>Menu → Custom Flags</em>.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for the images you import. Do not use images that contain nudity, hate symbols, or illegal content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertising and Rewarded Ads</h2>
    <p>Saving a Custom Flag requires watching <strong>one rewarded advertisement</strong>. AdMob may process data as described above to deliver and measure ads and to detect fraud/abuse. Where required, the app will present a consent prompt for personalized vs. non‑personalized ads.</p>

    <h2>Legal Basis & Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> In regions where consent is required (e.g., EEA/UK), we request your consent for ad personalization. If you decline, non‑personalized ads will be shown where supported.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt‑Out:</strong> You can reset your device’s advertising ID or limit ad tracking in your device settings. In supported regions, you can update ad consent choices via the in‑app prompt.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Photos/Media selection:</strong> Used only to let you choose an image for a Custom Flag. Files remain on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Network access:</strong> Required to load and show ads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>Custom Flag files are stored locally in the app’s private storage on your device. We do not maintain user accounts or remote databases for this app. Third‑party partners (e.g., AdMob, Unity) retain data according to their own policies.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>This app is <strong>not directed to children under 13</strong>. The target audience is 13+.</p>

    <h2>Third‑Party Privacy Policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google / AdMob Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unity Game Player and App User Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here with an updated <strong>Effective Date</strong>.</p>
