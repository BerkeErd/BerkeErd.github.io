    description: "Originally developed for Mağara Jam #4 in 3 days using Unity Engine, this game was initially built for PC platform. Later on, it has been developed further and ported for WebGL and Mobile platforms. Released on Feb 21, 2022. After creating the mobile and WebGL versions, I further developed the game by adding new weapons, enemies, and released it on the Steam platform. The game is also among the most beloved stickman games on various websites. It's a game where we try to survive by cutting down stickmen coming from all directions or allowing them to escape. The Steam version features support for over 20 languages, achievements, leaderboards with country information, a sandbox mode, and new weapons and enemies.",
