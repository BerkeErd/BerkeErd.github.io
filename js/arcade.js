    description: "Originally developed for Mağara Jam #4 in 3 days using Unity Engine, this game was initially built for PC platform. Later on, it has been developed further and ported for WebGL and Mobile platforms. Released on Feb 21, 2022. After creating the mobile and WebGL versions, I further developed the game by adding new weapons, enemies, and released it on the Steam platform. The game is also among the most beloved stickman games on various websites. It's a game where we try to survive by cutting down stickmen coming from all directions or allowing them to escape. The Steam version features support for over 20 languages, achievements, leaderboards with country information, a sandbox mode, and new weapons and enemies. The mobile version uses PlayFab SDK for leaderboards, while the Steam version utilizes Steamworks SDK for leaderboards and achievements.",

	  description: "This project shows how to build a multiplayer game using WebSockets with Unity WebGL. It uses the NativeWebSocket package to let the game talk directly to a Node.js and Express server on Glitch. The server handles things like player connections, making game rooms with join codes, and keeping the game state the same for both players.The game has a very simple design on purpose. The goal is to build the main multiplayer system, not to make the game look good. It includes features like finding other players, sending moves in real time, and showing the results. There might be small sync problems since it's still early in development. This project is mostly a way to learn how browser based multiplayer games can work with WebSockets.",
